        q: "¿Qué hace VYNTEX?",
        a: "Creamos automatizaciones con IA, sitios web, sistemas CRM, chatbots con IA, imagen de marca y marketing digital para negocios. En pocas palabras: te ayudamos a atraer clientes, responder más rápido y reducir el trabajo manual.",
      },
      {
        q: "¿A qué tipo de negocios atienden?",
        a: "Negocios de todo tamaño en todo Estados Unidos — servicios profesionales y de impuestos, legales, salud, servicios para el hogar, construcción, bienes raíces, restaurantes, comercio, belleza, automotriz, educación, agencias y negocios de varias ubicaciones.",
      },
      {
        q: "¿Qué es la automatización con IA?",
        a: "La automatización usa software para encargarse de pasos repetitivos por ti — calificar un cliente, enviar un seguimiento, agendar una cita o notificar a tu equipo — para que eso ocurra de forma consistente sin esfuerzo manual.",
      },
      {
        q: "¿VYNTEX puede conectarse con mis herramientas actuales?",
        a: "En la mayoría de los casos, sí. Lo que se puede conectar depende de tus sistemas y del alcance de tu proyecto. Lo confirmamos durante los pasos de Descubrir y Diseñar.",
      },
      {
        q: "¿Cuánto cuesta un sitio web?",
        a: "Los sitios web comienzan en $500 pago único para uno básico, $1,100 para uno estándar y $2,000+ para uno a medida. Los precios completos de cada servicio están en la sección de Precios.",
      },
      {
        q: "¿Los planes de mantenimiento son obligatorios?",
        a: "No. Los sitios web, herramientas y marca son compras únicas que te pertenecen. El mantenimiento es opcional. Los CRM llevan cuota de configuración más cuota mensual porque funcionan como un sistema continuo.",
      },
      {
        q: "¿Qué incluye el periodo de soporte de 30 días?",
        a: "Cada entrega incluye 30 días de soporte para preguntas, pequeños arreglos y ajustes después del lanzamiento. Los cambios después de ese periodo se cobran por hora.",
      },
      {
        q: "¿El hosting y las licencias de software están incluidos?",
        a: "No. Nuestros precios cubren solo nuestra mano de obra. El hosting, dominios, licencias de software o CRM, envío de correos/SMS, pauta publicitaria y plugins premium los cobra el proveedor por separado.",
      },
      {
        q: "¿Ofrecen servicio en inglés y español?",

      },
      {
        q: "¿Cuánto tarda un proyecto?",
        a: "Los tiempos dependen del alcance. Un sitio o herramienta simple avanza rápido; el trabajo de CRM o automatización a medida toma más tiempo. Te damos un cronograma en el paso de Diseñar antes de comenzar a construir.",
      },
      {
        q: "¿Garantizan clientes, ventas o posiciones en buscadores?",
        a: "No. Construimos sistemas y sitios web efectivos y bien estructurados, pero no garantizamos clientes, ventas ni posiciones específicas en buscadores — desconfía de quien lo haga.",
      },
      {
        q: "¿Qué es el programa de revendedor?",
        a: "Los socios aprobados revenden los servicios de VYNTEX a sus propios clientes a su propio precio mientras nosotros nos encargamos de la entrega. Tiene una activación anual de $199 y un mínimo de cuatro reventas por año. El precio mayorista se desbloquea tras la aprobación.",
